# Travelicious React/Node
Travel website made with ReactJs and NodeJs

## Installation


For optimal use, install the project in your user folder on the C: drive. 

Once done, open the project in a programming software and open two command terminals within it. They will be used to install the modules and start the front-end and back-end.

In the first terminal, navigate to the "backend" folder using the command "cd .\backend". Once in the "backend" folder, begin by installing the modules using the command "npm install" and wait until the download is complete. Then, start the server with the command "npm run server".

To ensure that the server has started correctly, make sure you receive the same response from the terminal as shown in the image below. If the last message does not appear, it means that the project could not access MongoDB. This could be due to several reasons:

- Your machine is not connected to the internet.
- The network being used does not allow this kind of interaction.
- The error is coming from MongoDB.

Once the server is started, open the second terminal and navigate to the "frontend" folder using the command "cd .\frontend". Just like with the backend, install the modules with "npm install", then start the frontend with the command "npm start". If the frontend has started successfully, the site will open in your browser.
